# Overwood-Team-Five
A team project to re-model the current Overwood website.

By default, I (Gibbs) have created the different sections that we shall develop in order to prevent conflicts during merging.
This is how the sections are:
1. The landing page/banner section is the first page, with the class section-1-banner
2. The Our Guarantee section is the second page, with the class section-2-our-guarantee
3. The Mission & Values section is the third page, with the class section-3-mission-values
4. The 6 Things You Should Know about us is the fourth page, with the class section-4-six-things
5. The Our Products section is the fifth page, with the class section-5-our-products
6. The Testimonials (What our Clients Say About Us) section is the sixth page, with the class section-6-testimonials
7. The Next Steps section is the seventh page, with the class section-7-next-steps
8. The Blog section is the eighth page, with the class section-8-blog
9. The Footer section is the ninth and last page, with the class section-9-footer
